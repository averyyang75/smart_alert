# Smart Alert

A smart alert system is designed to assist individuals with hearing impairments or reduced auditory awareness in detecting approaching hazards, without causing distractions in non-critical situationsâ€”even in noisy environments. The system will leverage sound recognition technology to identify critical sounds, assess risk based on location and motion activity, and choose the appropriate communication method to deliver alerts.
